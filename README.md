# The AutoCellRow (ACR)

The AutoCellRow (ACR) is a free libre open-source image-analysis tool to perform measurements of xylem cell traits in
high-quality images e.g., .tiff, .jpg, .bmp, .png, formats) developed in Python Programming Language and working in
Microsoft Windows environment.

The ACR is maximally automated and intuitive software orientated to quantify xylem cell traits along the radial axis of
cell radial files in cross-sectional images of conifers. The number of xylem cell traits measured by ACR is broad,
including cell lumen diameter, cell wall thickness, cell size, recognition of early and latewood cells, among others.
In addition, ACR allows to automatically plot a tracheidogram of a chosen row within a giving tree-ring, being of
interest for the seasonal analysis of xylem cell traits.

Thus, ACR offers an excellent alternative to the general and semiautomatic QWA tools currently available.
